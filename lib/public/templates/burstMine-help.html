	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>
		Burst is a coin based on a Proof of HDD capacity (PoC) algorithm. Thus, to mine this coin you need to provide as much free HDD space as you want.
		The more HDD space you dedicate to Burst, the more coins you'll earn with the mining process.
	</p>
	<p>
		To prepare this free space, you'll have to go through a <a ui-sref="dashboard.plotting">plotting</a> process.
		This step will fill your amount of free space with a lot of generated chunk of data (called <code>scoops</code>) required by the <a ui-sref="dashboard.mining">mining</a> process.
		Once plotted, your HDD space can be used by any Burst miner to mine some coins.
	</p>
	<p>
		Burst mine is a distributed and graphical web interface to handle the whole <a ui-sref="dashboard.plotting">plotting</a> and <a ui-sref="dashboard.mining">mining</a> process to make it easier to use.
		It also provides a live monitoring system and can be scaled to fit your needs (see <code>multiple instances</code>).
	</p>
	<h2>Basics</h2>
	<p>
		Burst mine is a plugin-based system, thus it can be extended in many ways.
		The following categories sum up all the components that can be added via the plugin system.
	</p>
	<h3>Generator</h3>
	<p>
		A generator is a component used to generate scoops. Each scoop is a 64 bytes chunk of data.
		By construction, those scoops are produced per pack of 4096 (called a <code>plot</code>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The generation step needs three parameters:
		<ul>
			<li><code>address</code>: Your Burst numerical account address. This address can be found on the official wallet.</li>
			<li><code>offset</code>: The first plot number from where to start the generation.</li>
			<li><code>workSize</code>: The number of plots to generate.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Plots file</h3>
	<p>
		Once generated, the scoops need to be reordered before being written to a file.
		Each plots file holds one or more plots with reordered scoops.
		The number of plots in a file is called the <code>plotsNumber</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A plots file embed two components:
		<ul>
			<li><code>writer</code>: This component is responsible for reordering and writing the generated scoops to the file.</li>
			<li><code>reader</code>: This component is responsible for reading scoops from the file in the mining process.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two main strategies to store the scoops in the final file:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>staggered</code>: This version reorders the scoops in an intermediate buffer before writing them.
				The buffer length is expressed in plots number with the <code>staggerSize</code> parameter.
				In this configuration, the <code>plotsNumber</code> parameter must be a multiple of <code>staggerSize</code>.
				<ul>
					<li>Pros: Fast reordering and writing.</li>
					<li>Cons: The lower the <code>staggerSize</code>, the more I/O access will be required by the mining process.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>direct</code>: This version writes the scoops directly to the file (with a potential pre-caching).
				<ul>
					<li>Pros: Generates fully optimized plots file (<code>staggerSize = plotsNumber</code>).</li>
					<li>Cons: The number of random I/O access is greatly increased, thus slowing down the writing speed.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>Generation strategy</h3>
	<p>
		The generation strategy uses generators to create plots files. Each strategy comes with its pros and cons.
		It is up to you to select the best strategy based on your hardware capabilities.
	</p>
	<h3>Optimizer</h3>
	<p>
		To reduce the disk stress while mining, it is advised to use the highest possible <code>staggerSize</code>.
		An optimizer is a component used to increase the <code>staggerSize</code> parameter of an already plotted file to match the <code>plotsNumber</code> parameter.
